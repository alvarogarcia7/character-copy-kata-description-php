# Character Copy Kata 

## Introduction

This is a legacy code kata, to practice breaking the dependencies (i.e., dependency-breaking techniques)

## Description

This is an `REPL` program: 

  * Read from the console
  * Evalutate the line (Identity function)
  * Print the evaluation
  * Loop (again)

## Tasks

### Adding tests

Add tests for the functionality

### Evaluation improvement

Detect bad words (read them from a CSV file, one word per line). Do not alter the printing yet.

### Printing improvement

When detecting bad words, print "****" (one star for each character).
The detection invalidates the whole line, not only the bad word itself
